Entering my 3rd year s a graduate student, I've noticed how greatly I've changed as a person, particularly regarding my attitude towards science. In short, I once naively considered myself well-prepared for this career path. I soon became more grounded, and have since been constantly dealing with various degrees of anxiety regarding things such as my competence as a student or scientist, and the future outlook of my career. My experience with science has been consistently one of unrelenting disappointment, retrospective self-admonishment, and borderline nihilism. For better or for worse, I have continued working on my research projects, focusing on troubleshooting issues as they arise, with varying levels of motivation according to the intensity of my feelings of hopelessness. By far, the most degrading quality of the scientific experience is chronic failure. Dealing with the ensuing emotions - incompetence, hopelessness, cynicism, even fear - continues to be mentally taxing on a daily basis. Perhaps, there is a silver-lining, however faint - the much-coveted, rare, and unexpected events of apparent scientific 'success.' Pure, specific PCR bands. Abundant protein expression. These scarce moments can occur with intense euphoria, elation. As they should. But a strained, tired mind feels but fleeting solace before returning to the subjugation of an implacable anxiety. 

The monster within is not necessarily an irrational existence. Like a rotting tree, the causative factors are often environmental. The simplest response is to submit to, and become incapacitated by, our internalized fears. This leads to a passive, dismissive, neglective attitude to work, and perhaps even other areas of life. Productivity suffers, perpetuating the cycle - a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Currently, I don't have a solution. As mentioned above, I continue to confront my worries daily. Importantly, we should be more forgiving of ourselves. While we can always strive to improve, we should be satisfied with our investment in consistency. I currently aim to prioritize modest, but regular, advances. Personally, I derive a lot of inspiration from role models, whether they are peers or online strangers. Reminding myself of their existence seems to provide some level of motivation. Heading into 2021, I will continue pursuing results in these directions. No guarantess for their effectiveness, though.
