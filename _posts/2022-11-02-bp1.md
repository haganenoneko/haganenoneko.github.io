# Test post (automating markdown formatting)

This markdown file was used as a test for a Python script I wrote to automatically format 'natural' markdown into something blog-ready (i.e. adding CSS headers, post metadata, renaming local image paths to URLs, etc.). 

The script is available at [format_md.py](https://github.com/haganenoneko/haganenoneko.github.io/blob/7d04e981475e97279554705abc94bd9fc16e1c5e/_posts/format_md.py). For the sake of not wasting a post, I'll briefly write about how the script works and what it does.

## Header information

My blogposts require a header with basic metadata, including a permalink, title, and tags. An example is shown below:

```markdown
---
title: "today"
date: 2022-11-02
permalink: /posts/2022/11/bp1
tags:
---
```

I also like to add a bit of CSS to center my figures and modify caption presentation, which I add after the metadata block above:

```CSS
<style>
    pre {font-size: 12;}
    h3 {font-size: 1.35em;}
    h4 {font-size: 1.2em;}

    .inline-block {
        display: inline-block;
    }

    .container {
        max-width: 100vw; 
        margin: 0;
        horizontal-align: middle;
    }
</style>
```

Besides this, the only other modification the script makes is to replace local image paths with URLs (in the GitHub repo for this website) where the images will eventually be uploaded once commits are made and pushed. All this takes is a bit of `regex` and string manipulation. For example, all of my 'natural' markdown figures look like the following:

```markdown

![Figure 1](/path/to/a/picture.png "Figure 1")
**Figure 1. A caption.**

```

Of course, the bolded text is barely any different from normal body text (except that it's bolded), which is why I like to wrap the figure, caption, and alt-text in an HTML `<figure></figure>` environment, e.g.

```html
<br>
<figure>
  <center>
    <img 
      src="https://github.com/haganenoneko/haganenoneko.github.io/blob/master/_posts/figs/2022-10-19-figs/CARS_StatsByDate.png?raw=true"
      alt="CARS statistics over time"
      title="Figure 1" width="100%" height="100%"
      style="horizontal-align:middle"
    />
  </center>
  <figcaption>
    <b> Fig. 1.  "Figure 1" </b>
    <br>
    <p> Changes in key metrics over time. </p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>
```

which gives the figure below:


<br>
<figure>
  <center>
    <img 
      src="https://github.com/haganenoneko/haganenoneko.github.io/blob/master/_posts/figs/2022-10-19-figs/CARS_StatsByDate.png?raw=true"
      alt="CARS statistics over time"
      title="Figure 1" width="100%" height="100%"
      style="horizontal-align:middle"
    />
  </center>
  <figcaption>
    <b> Fig. 1.  "Figure 1" </b>
    <br>
    <p> Changes in key metrics over time. </p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

## Formatting figures

The code that performs this transition is fairly intuitive (I think). It's part of a `class` (so I can instantiate it once and re-use it with multiple files, if needed), so there are some variables that aren't defined, but the basic logic is:

First, apply a `regex` pattern that combs through the original markdown for in-line figures that match the pattern below:

```markdown
![alt-text](path "title")\n**Figure #**. Caption
```
We want to extract `alt-text`, `path`, `title`, the figure `#`, and finally, the `Caption`. We can do this with the following `regex` pattern, which is pretty messy, so you can trust me that it works if you don't want to test it:

```
"\!\[(.*)\]\(([^\s]+)(.*)\)\n\*\*(?:(?:Figure|Fig)\.{0,1}\s)(\d)\.\s(.*)\*\*
```

Second, every time we encounter a figure in the raw text, we want to:

1. Keep all the non-figure text that preceded it,
2. Embed all the extracted information (e.g. title, alt-text, etc.) into the HTML environment shown above, and
3. Append any remaining non-figure text between this figure and the next figure, or the end of the document, if there are no more figures left.

An easy way to do this is to initialize an empty string `''` and grow it accordingly. To do so, we want the indices for the beginning and end of each in-line figure in the original text. Conveniently, `regex` `Match` results have `start()` and `end()` methods that give us exactly these indices. So, we can collect all the information we need (`figinfo` below) and then grow our string by using these indices. 

Well, that's pretty much it. One other small feature of the script is copying local files to a post-specific directory, if the figure path points to a local file. Otherwise, if the figure path is a URL, the URL is used as-is. 

```python

# Full script available at:
# https://github.com/haganenoneko/haganenoneko.github.io/blob/7d04e981475e97279554705abc94bd9fc16e1c5e/_posts/format_md.py

def format_inline_figures(self, figDir: Path, **figkw) -> str:

      figinfo = [
          (r.start(), r.end(), r.groups()) 
          for r in self._fig_pat.finditer(self.text)
      ]

      newText = ''
      lastInd = 0 

      date_ = datetime.strftime(self.postDate, format=r"%Y-%m-%d")

      for start, end, info in figinfo:
          
          newText += self.text[lastInd:start]
          
          if len(info) == 5:
              alt, fp, title, num, cap = info 
          else:
              alt, fp, num, cap = info 
              title = None 

          fpath = Path(fp)
          if fpath.is_file():
              to_fp = figDir / f"{fpath.stem}{fpath.suffix}"
              shutil.copy(fpath, to_fp)
              assert to_fp.is_file()
              figpath = self._fig_url.format(
                  date=date_, 
                  name=fp.stem
              )
          else:
              figpath = str(fp)

          figtext = self.create_figure_env(
              figpath = figpath,
              fignum = num,
              title = title,
              caption = cap,
              alt_text = alt, 
              **figkw   
          )

          newText += figtext 
          lastInd = end + 1 

      return newText + self.text[lastInd:]
```

## Nothing.

Just some blank thoughts. 

For one, I ended up writing another blogpost (following my previous one) a lot sooner than I expected. Well, there's probably also the fact that working on this script required preparing some test material (lol), so there's that. 

Since I've got the script working (hopefully), I'm fairly eager to write a couple more posts - nothing impressive, of course (as always). Probably on things I've been working on as a NEET, such as:

1. a collection of tools to help automate various parts of 'clipping' (creating and translating clips of [VTuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber) streams
2. my activities as a 'clipper,' primarily of [VSPO](https://vspo.jp/en/), but occasionally of [Nijisanji](https://www.nijisanji.jp/) and [Hololive](https://en.hololive.tv/)
3. scraping and analysis of data for [VSPO](https://vspo.jp/en/)-related clips

Some projects/goals I've put on 'hold' (i.e. will likely resume in < 1mo)

1. analyzing personal life data collecting using [Daylio](https://daylio.net/). the issue I have with these data is that most/all of the data are categorical, and I need to first make sure I understand logistic regression and GLMs well before tackling these data again, since my initial attempts at model-building yielded horrendous results. 
2. learning to package the 'clipping' scripts above (mostly various Python functions that write pre-packaged `ffmpeg` commands for, e.g. crossfading, cutting, and downloading videos) into a desktop app. I feel like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) would be a good choice, and I might learn a thing or two about TypeScript (finally) if I do so
3. writing a manuscript about my MSc thesis

Longer-term projects, which I hopefully aim to start or restart within the next couple months, and will probably extend for at least a year:

1. learning to manage my finances more effectively, especially given the tumultuous year for stocks in general
2. preparing to write JLPT N2 next July (maybe even N1?)
3. working through Griffith's Electrodynamics (to prepare for reading more from [Bioelectromagnetism](https://www.bem.fi/book/))
4. there are a bunch of topics I want to learn or relearn, including multivariable calculus and linear algebra (for the millionth time, I know - I just keep forgetting stuff!), statistics (the basic frequentist stuff, of course, but also time series, GLMs, and some basics of spatial statistics, experimental design, and item response theory)

Of course, both my family and I are largely broke, so I'm primarily focusing right now on figuring out a way to get back into school or get a job.
