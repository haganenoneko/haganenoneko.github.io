It's been a while since I've updated my blog. I'd like to share a couple updates on what I've been doing, and what I hope to accomplish within the next month. I'll start in chronological order, making note of the approximate dates when I worked on things. 

Also, my laptop is acting up right now, so I can't add links (freezes while typing every $n$ characters...). I really need a new machine, don't I. If anyone is willing to hire me, or sponsor a new machine... of course not... right?

# Part I: Exploration and computational experiments. 
By July 2021, I had completed my last, pre-defense committee meeting, and was fully committed on writing my thesis. However, there were several unturned stones that were bothering me, and in the absence of both intervention and calculated reasoning, I decided to spend my newfound time away from the lab in exploring these ideas. I was initially quite confident that I could complete what I wanted to do in a couple weeks. The subtext, of course, is that I didn't, and, since none of this work will be in my thesis nor any eventual publication, I wasted several months, and continue to face the emotional, physical, and financial consequences of this series of unfortunate decisions.

Regrets aside, what did I actually accomplish in this period (roughly July through to September)? 

## Molecular dynamics (MD)

By this, I mean that I used [OpenMM](https://openmm.org) and mostly-default [CHARMM-GUI](https://www.charmm-gui.org/) settings to perform all-atom simulations of WT and F431A HCN2 channels. The homology models were built using the [SwissModel](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/) server from HCN1 (PDB: 5U6O, 5U6P, 6UQF, and 6UQG). These pilot experiments were inspired by those of the isolated segment of Kv1.5 channels shown in [Labro et al. (2003)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13679372/). This study was interesting because it focused on the *PVP* hinge motif, the first proline of which is homologous to F431 in HCN2, and showed that this first proline was required for channel opening. Their MD simulations were fairly limited, at 10 ns in duration and involving only the four S6 segments. The authors suggested that the first proline in the *PVP* motif introduces a kink that allows the pore to dilate upon voltage-sensor activation. 

However, the mechanism of pore opening likely differ between HCN and Kv channels. There are several reasons for this, including:

### 1. Different relative arrangements of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and pore domain (PD).
In HCN channels, VSDs interact with PDs of the *same* subunit, whereas in Kv channels, VSDs interact with PDs of *adjacent* subunits. These configurations are called 'non-domain swapped' and 'domain-swapped,' respectively. 

### 2. Differences in VSD-PD ('electromechanical') coupling.
Due to the different structural arrangements of the PD and VSD, the mechanism by which voltage-sensing is coupled to the pore is also different. However, the most striking evidence of this is that HCN channels activate upon hyperpolarization, rather than depolarization like most Kv channels, despite HCN channels being members of the latter. In fact, gating currents also show that the S4 segments also move similarly upon changes in membrane potential (e.g. Mannikko et al. (2002), Ryu et al. (2012)). 

### 3. Differences in opening energetics and kinetics.
The current model of HCN channel activation is that, in the depolarized state, the VSDs push the pore closed and are thus autoinhibitory for channel opening. This is supported by structures of HCN1 and HCN4  that show tight planar arrays formed by S4, S5, and S6 (Lee and MacKinnon (2017), Saponaro et al. (2021)). The next key idea comes from my Master's lab in an alanine/valine scan of 20-odd residues in the distal S6 of HCN2. In this study, Vincenzo ('Enzo') Macri, a PhD alum, found that the majority of mutants exhibited compromised opening (Macri et al. (2009)). In contrast, similar studies in *Shaker* Kv channels showed the opposite, i.e. that most mutations in the distal pore resulted in greater opening at rest. A straightforward interpretation of these observations is that the energetics of pore opening differ between *Shaker* and HCN: the open state is intrinsically *less* favourable in *Shaker*, but *more* favourable in HCN chanels. 

Hyperpolarization-dependent activation in HCN channels can therefore be explained as follows. Though the open state of the pore is energetically favoured, it cannot open upon depolarization due to autoinhibition from the VSDs, which pack against and close the pore at rest (depolarization). However, when displaced by hyperpolarization, VSD-PD contact is weakened, allowing the pore to *relax* into an open state. In contrast, opening of Kv channels is *active* and requires S4s the 'pull' the S6 gate open (hence, 'electromechanical'), whereas closing is passive. 

Below are some additional, noteworthy observations regarding electromechanical coupling in HCN and Kv channels.

#### a. Kv channels require an S4-S5 linker, but not HCN channels.
Electromechanical coupling in Kv channels requires a short, intracellular linker between the S4 and S5 ('S4-S5 linker'), presumably to transduce the aforementioned force of 'pulling.' Conversely, deletion or truncation of the S4-S5 linker does not impair normal gating in HCN channels. In fact, this appears to be the case for a number of '[non-domain swapped](#different-relative-arrangements-of-the-voltage-sensing-domain-vsd-and-pore-domain-pd)' channels, including [hERG and rEAG (Lorinczi et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25818916/).

#### b. Weak VSD-PD coupling.
VSD-PD coupling is *very* weak in HCN channels! For one, kinetic models have predicted allosteric coupling factors that are at least 100 times less than those of *Shaker* ([Ryu et al. (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23071265/), [Flynn et al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30076228/)). Secondly, many mutations of the S4 and S5 cause raise baseline conductance at positive voltages, or even result in constitutively open channels (e.g. [Cheng et al. (2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17578902/), [Wemhöner et al. (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23048023/), [Ramentol et al. (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32184399/)). This may seem surprising, given the result of mutations in the distal S6, but actually, this actually has a very intuitive explanation. 

Given the favourable energetics of pore opening, constitutive opening would be expected in the absence of either: (1) voltage-sensing or (2) VSD-PD interaction. Since VSD-PD coupling is weak and required for deactivation, but not activation, channel closing is easily compromised by relatively small perturbations.
