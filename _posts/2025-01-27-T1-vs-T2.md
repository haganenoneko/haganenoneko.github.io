The overall signal intensity (S) of a **spin echo** sequence is:
$$
S = K \cdot [H] \cdot (1 - e^{-TR/T1}) \cdot e^{-TE/T2}
$$

Where,
- $K$ is a scaling factor
- $[H]$ is the spin (proton) density
- $TR$ and $TE$ are the repetition and echo times, respectively
- $T1$ determines the rate at which the protons return to their normal spin, while 
- $T2$ determines the rate at which the protons either reach equilibrium or go out of phase with each other.
- the exponential terms $e^{-x}$ are the T1 or T2 weighting terms

The table below summarizes how this equation helps us understand the effects of short and long TE and TR on MRI contrast. 
- Naturally, $e^{-x} \in [0, 1]$
- When $e^{-x} \approx 1$, the effect of the term on signal intensity is negligible
- As such, the effects of T1 or T2 on signal intensity *increase* when their respective exponential terms *decrease*, i.e. approach zero

| ↑ TE | x                                                               | $e^{-TE/T2} \rightarrow 0$, so T2 effects will *increase*  |
| ↓ TR | $(1 - e^{-TR/T1}) \rightarrow 0$, so T1 effects will *increase* | x                                                          |
| ↑ TR | $(1 - e^{-TR/T1}) \rightarrow 1$, so T1 effects will *decrease* | x                                                          |

> Another way to understand the effect of _TE_ on T2-weighting is to consider the signals generated by two tissues with different T2 values. When _TE_ is short, the echo occurs when there has been little time for T2-decay to have taken place and hence the tissues are not differentiated. If _TE_ is long, the relative differences in signal decay between the two tissues become more noticeable, and hence more "T2-weighting."
