	abstract = {Encompasses the full range of computational science and engineering from modelling to solution, both analytical and numerical. It develops a framework for the equations and numerical methods of applied mathematics. Gilbert Strang has taught this material to thousands of engineers and scientists (and many more on MIT's OpenCourseWare 18.085-6) ... The book is solution-based and not formula-based: it integrates analysis and algorithms and MATLAB codes to explain each topic as effectively as possible. The topics include applied linear algebra and fast solvers, differential equations with finite differences and finite elements, Fourier analysis and optimization. This book also serves as a reference for the whole community of computational scientists and engineers. Supporting resources, including MATLAB codes, problem solutions and video lectures from Gilbert Strang's 18.085 courses at MIT, are provided at math.mit.edu/cse"--Publisher's website},
