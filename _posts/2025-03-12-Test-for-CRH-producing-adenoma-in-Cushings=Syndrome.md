# Test for CRH producing adenoma in Cushings-Syndrome

Cushing's Syndrome is defined by features of glucocorticoid excess. Most commonly, these include: central obesity, rounded face, facial plethora, decreased libido. In humans, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is the hypothalamic releasing hormone that controls the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and thus glucocorticoid production. In rare instances, CRH-secreting tumours can arise and result in Cushing's Syndrome.

The standard workup for the differential diagnosis of Cushing's Syndrome is shown below [2]. Note, however, that it does not explicitly mention CRH-secreting tumours due to their rarity. However, the same tests that are effective in distinguishing Cushing's disease (ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas) from ectopic sources of ACTH, such as neuroendocrine tumours (e.g. multiple endocrine neoplasias) and small cell lung cancer. Briefly, the workup proceeds as follows:

<div class="image-container" style="margin: 2rem auto; max-width: 800px; text-align: center;"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haganenoneko/haganenoneko.github.io/refs/heads/master/_posts/images/2025-03-12-11-41-21.png.png" alt="2025-03-12-11-41-21.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" /> <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0; color: #666; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">Tumours responsible for ectopic ACTH secretion</p></div>

1. Suspicion of Cushing's Syndrome is established based on history, clinical features, and/or screening labs, which may include random cortisol.
2. Hypercortisolism is established biochemically with two or more of the following (including repeats):
   1. *Elevated* 24-hour urine free cortisol levels
   2. *Lack of suppression* in the 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test (aka "low-dose" DST)
   3. *Elevated* late-night (or midnight) salivary cortisol levels
3. Plasma ACTH levels are measured, whereby *elevated* ACTH levels indicate "ACTH-dependent" Cushing's Syndrome, and *low* ACTH levels indicated "ACTH-independent" Cushing's Syndrome.
4. ACTH excess and hypercortisolism require further workup to distinguish between pituitary and extra-pituitary sources of ACTH (Cushing's disease and ectopic Cushing's syndrome, respectively). This involves:
   1. *Lack of supression* in the high-dose DST suggests an *ectopic* source of ACTH. This can involve a single 8-mg dose (at midnight, with cortisol measured the next morning), or a 48-h course of 2-mg administered every 6 hours. Notably, the false positive rate is fairly high in both ectopic and pituitary disease, so Greenspan [3] claims that this test is no longer useful.
   2. *Concomitant increases in ACTH and cortisol* following CRH stimulation suggests a *pituitary* source of ACTH. However, the thresholds to distinguish ectopic and pituitary disease are quite high. 
   3. *High central-to-peripheral ratios of ACTH* in inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS), taken before and after CRH stimulation, is the gold standard for diagnosing pituitary disease.
   4. Notably, the presence of other hormones and tumour markers commonly secreted by *ectopic* ACTH-secreting tumours are also helpful.
5. Radiologic evaluation is helpful to guide diagnoses/treatment, e.g. MRI of the sella for Cushing's disease or CTs of the chest and/or abdomen to look for ectopic tumours.

The same tests can be applied to CRH-secreting tumours. For example:
- Initial biochemical screening will reveal high levels of ACTH and cortisol
- Due to their ectopic origin, neither low- nor high-dose DST will suppress ACTH levels
- With CRH stimulation, ACTH levels may or may not increase above baseline. The case for a *lack* of elevation would be that corticotrophs are already fully stimulated. However, corticotrophs may also undergo hyperplasia, which may allow them to respond to CRH stimulation with elevated ACTH release. Indeed, Greenspan states that this can cause false positives in CRH stimulation testing [3].
- Imaging may reveal corticotroph hyperplasia, as mentioned above.
- With IPSS, an ectopic CRH-producing tumour produces a high central-to-peripheral ratio of ACTH, which is analogous to Cushing's disease. Therefore, while a high IPS:P ratio strongly suggests CD, it does not exclude the possibility of a CRH-secreting tumour.
