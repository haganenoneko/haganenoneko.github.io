In this post, I will write about my experience working with custom voltage protocols. I will focus on how I create the protocol files for measurement in Clampex, and how I analyze the resulting recordings.

# Introduction to Voltage Protocols
The most common electrophysiology hardware systems are made by Axon Instruments and HEKA Instruments. Both come with proprietary acquisition and analysis software that are jam packed with features. In voltage clamp experiments, a sequence of voltage steps, called a *voltage protocol*, is applied, and the resulting electrical currents are recorded. The steps of a protocol are usually of three varieties: (1) a flat pulse, (2) a linear ramp, or (3) a 'train' of pulses with some specified frequency. In each, duration and/or voltage can be specified during protocol creation. As such, each step, or *epoch*, of a protocol does not change its type, but the protocol can be repeated for several iterations (*sweeps*) where the duration(s) and/or voltage(s) of one or more steps change. 

To summarize some relevant terminology:

* **Protocol**: a pre-defined time course of voltages, in a voltage-clamp experiment, that is applied to the system being recorded. When constructed using common proprietary software, protocols consist of discrete epochs which can have multiple types, durations, and voltages. 
* **Epoch**: a single step in a protocol which has a specific type, duration, and voltage. When a protocol is repeated, the duration and voltage, but not the type, of a given epoch may change. 
* **Sweep**: an iteration of a protocol with epochs of different durations and/or voltages. When a protocol consists of more than one sweep, there is a short period of time between the end of one sweep and the beginning of the next known as the *inter-sweep interval*.
* **Pre-trigger length**: an automatically specified, unchangeable interval at the start of each sweep that precedes the onset of the first epoch. 

## Limitations of Common Protocol Design

There are several unavoidable limitations when using pClamp (Axon Instruemnts) or Patch Master (HEKA) to design voltage protocols. Importantly, the number of steps in each sweep of a protocol is typically limited to around 10 or so. Consequently, these software cannot be used to create complex waveforms such as membrane potentials recorded from live cells (this is sometimes called 'action potential clamp') and computationally optimized protocols. However, even if you're not doing anything particularly fancy, but just want to implement best-practices for protocol design (e.g. leak ramps, reversal ramps, membrane test steps), you can still run out of space in the protocol designer. I ran into both of these issues, so I decided to look into how to create custom protocols for use in Clampex (Axon Instruments). 

# Protocol Creation
Using Python, it's fairly straightforward to create a custom protocol. Briefly, all you need to do is to prepare your protocol as a Numpy array. For example, let's create a sinusoidal protocol that contains two sweeps with a holding potential of -35 mV. 

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 

def sine_(A, x, t, C=-35.0):
    return A * np.sin(x/t) + C 

# seed RNG
np.random.seed(123)
# random amplitudes
A = 100*np.random.randn(6)
# random frequencies 
F = 1000*np.random.randn(6)
# time points 
t = np.arange(0, 8000, 0.5)

# sine waves 
sines = [t]
sines.extend(
        [sine_(A[i], t, F[i]) + sine_(A[i+1], t, F[i+1]) + \
        sine_(A[i+2], t, F[i+2]) for i in range(0, 6, 3)]
)

# plotting 
plt.plot(t, sines[0])
plt.plot(t, sines[1])
plt.ylabel("Voltage (mV)")
plt.xlabel("Time (ms)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

When we run the code above, we can see what our voltage protocol looks like.

Next, we get the protocol ready in a single array of size T x (N + 1), where T is the number of timepoints, and N is the number of sweeps. The first column contains the timepoints of measurement, while subsequent columns contain corresponding voltages. Finally, we save this array to a CSV file. 
```
sines = np.vstack(sines).T
# sines.shape = (16000, 3)

save_path = "..."
np.savetxt(save_path, sines, delimiter=",")
```

## Creating the ATF file
This is a separate (sub)-section because I think it's so cool, and because it's only possible due to somebody else's work (Scott W Harden). Broadly, 

1. Read the CSV file that we created above
2. Create an appropriate 'header' for the ATF file
3. Parse each row of the CSV file as a single `string`, yielding the entire CSV file as one, large `string`

We can read the CSV file using any method. I prefer using `pd.read_csv`, and then converting this to an array by calling `.values` on the resulting `DataFrame`.

ATF files contain a header that specifies information about the recording, such as sampling frequency, the number of sweeps, and the mode of stimulation. An example is shown below, assuming `df_data` is our custom protocol:

```
def default_header():
    
    ATF_HEADER="""
    ATF	1.0
    8	NUMBER_OF_SWEEPS
    "AcquisitionMode=Episodic Stimulation"
    "Comment="
    "YTop=200"
    "YBottom=-200"
    "SyncTimeUnits=20"
    "SweepStartTimesMS=0.000"
    "SignalsExported=IN 0   OUT 0"
    "Signals="	"IN 0"
    "Time (s)"
    """.strip()
    # "Time (s)"	"Trace #1"  "Trace #2"
    
    return ATF_HEADER

def make_header(df_data):
    """
    Create ATF header with appropriate number of sweeps and column labels  
    Returns string containing ATF header 
    """
    ATF_HEADER = default_header()
    head = ATF_HEADER.replace("NUMBER_OF_SWEEPS", 
                                str(df_data.shape[1]-1))
        
    for i in range(1, df_data.shape[1]):
        head += "\t" + """	"Trace #{i}" """"".format(i=i).strip()
    
    return head

# head = make_header(df_data)
```

Next, we go through the protocol row-by-row, converting each row into a string, and then appending the string to our header above. The final string can then be written to an `.ATF` file using basic Python.

```
def make_row(t, row):
    """
    Convert single `row` of data into string format for .ATF file. 
    `t` = time (index of row divided by sampling frequency) 
        
    Returns string `s` representing respective row in ATF file 
    """
    s = "\n%0.5f" % t 
    for v in row[1:]:
        s += "\t%0.5f" % v
    
    return s 

def create_atf(filename=r"./output.atf"):
    """
    Save a stimulus waveform array as an ATF 1.0 file with filename `filename`
    """
    # create ATF header 
    header = make_header()
    
    # instantiate output string, beginning with ATF header 
    # data for each trace and tiempoint will be added as newlines (rows) 
    out = header
    
    # sampling frequency
    rate = 1000/(df_data[1,0] - df_data[0,0])
    print(" The sampling frequency is %.0f kHz" % rate)
    
    for i, val in enumerate(df_data):
        out += make_row(i/rate, val)
        
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(out)
        print("wrote", filename)
```

It's currently 4:30AM where I am right now, so I'll leave it here for now...
