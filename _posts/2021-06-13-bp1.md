# Introduction to Voltage Protocols
The most common electrophysiology hardware systems are made by Axon Instruments and HEKA Instruments. Both come with proprietary acquisition and analysis software that are jam packed with features. In voltage clamp experiments, a sequence of voltage steps, called a *voltage protocol*, is applied, and the resulting electrical currents are recorded. The steps of a protocol are usually of three varieties: (1) a flat pulse, (2) a linear ramp, or (3) a 'train' of pulses with some specified frequency. In each, duration and/or voltage can be specified during protocol creation. As such, each step, or *epoch*, of a protocol does not change its type, but the protocol can be repeated for several iterations (*sweeps*) where the duration(s) and/or voltage(s) of one or more steps change. 

To summarize some relevant terminology:

* **Protocol**: a pre-defined time course of voltages, in a voltage-clamp experiment, that is applied to the system being recorded. When constructed using common proprietary software, protocols consist of discrete epochs which can have multiple types, durations, and voltages. 
* **Epoch**: a single step in a protocol which has a specific type, duration, and voltage. When a protocol is repeated, the duration and voltage, but not the type, of a given epoch may change. 
* **Sweep**: an iteration of a protocol with epochs of different durations and/or voltages. When a protocol consists of more than one sweep, there is a short period of time between the end of one sweep and the beginning of the next known as the *inter-sweep interval*.
* **Pre-trigger length**: an automatically specified, unchangeable interval at the start of each sweep that precedes the onset of the first epoch. 

## Limitations of Common Protocol Design

There are several unavoidable limitations when using pClamp (Axon Instruemnts) or Patch Master (HEKA) to design voltage protocols. Importantly, the number of steps in each sweep of a protocol is typically limited to around 10 or so. Consequently, these software cannot be used to create complex waveforms such as membrane potentials recorded from live cells (this is sometimes called 'action potential clamp') and computationally optimized protocols. However, even if you're not doing anything particularly fancy, but just want to implement best-practices for protocol design (e.g. leak ramps, reversal ramps, membrane test steps), you can still run out of space in the protocol designer. I ran into both of these issues, so I decided to look into how to create custom protocols for use in Clampex (Axon Instruments). 

# Protocol Creation
Using Python, it's fairly straightforward to create a custom protocol. Briefly, all you need to do is to prepare your protocol as a Numpy array. For example, let's create a sinusoidal protocol that contains two sweeps with a holding potential of -35 mV. 

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import numpy as np 

def sine_(A, x, t, C=-35.0):
    return A * np.sin(x/t) + C 

def create_protocol(show=False, save=None):
    # seed RNG
    np.random.seed(1337)
    # random amplitudes
    A = 100*np.random.rand(9)
    # random frequencies 
    F = 1000*np.random.rand(9)

    t = np.arange(0, 4000, 0.5)
    sines = [t]

    sines.extend([
        np.sum([sine_(A[i + 2*j], t, F[i + 2*j]) for i in range(3)], axis=0) for j in range(3)
    ])

    if show:
        for s in sines[1:]:
            plt.plot(t, s)
        plt.ylabel("Voltage (mV)")
        plt.xlabel("Time (ms)")
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()
    
    if save:
        sines = np.vstack(sines).T
        print(sines.shape)
        
        np.savetxt(save, sines, delimiter=",")

create_protocol(show=True, save="...")
```

When we run the code above, we can see what our voltage protocol looks like.

Next, we get the protocol ready in a single array of size T x (N + 1), where T is the number of timepoints, and N is the number of sweeps. The first column contains the timepoints of measurement, while subsequent columns contain corresponding voltages. Finally, we save this array to a CSV file. 


## Creating the ATF file
This is a separate (sub)-section because I think it's so cool, and because it's only possible due to somebody else's work (Scott W Harden). Broadly, 

1. Read the CSV file that we created above
2. Create an appropriate 'header' for the ATF file
3. Parse each row of the CSV file as a single `string`, yielding the entire CSV file as one, large `string`

We can read the CSV file using any method. I prefer using `pd.read_csv`, and then converting this to an array by calling `.values` on the resulting `DataFrame`.

```
import pandas as pd 

# path to saved CSV file 
filename = "..."
df_data = pd.read_csv(filename, header=0).to_numpy()
```

ATF files contain a header that specifies information about the recording, such as sampling frequency, the number of sweeps, and the mode of stimulation. An example is shown below, assuming `df_data` is our custom protocol:

```
def default_header():
    
    ATF_HEADER="""
    ATF	1.0
    8	NUMBER_OF_SWEEPS
    "AcquisitionMode=Episodic Stimulation"
    "Comment="
    "YTop=200"
    "YBottom=-200"
    "SyncTimeUnits=20"
    "SweepStartTimesMS=0.000"
    "SignalsExported=IN 0   OUT 0"
    "Signals="	"IN 0"
    "Time (s)"
    """.strip()
    
    return ATF_HEADER

def make_header(df_data):
    """
    Create ATF header with appropriate number of sweeps and column labels  
    Returns string containing ATF header 
    """
    ATF_HEADER = default_header()
    head = ATF_HEADER.replace("NUMBER_OF_SWEEPS", 
                                str(df_data.shape[1]-1))
        
    for i in range(1, df_data.shape[1]):
        head += "\t" + """	"Trace #{i}" """"".format(i=i).strip()
    
    return head

# head = make_header(df_data)
```

Next, we go through the protocol row-by-row, converting each row into a string, and then appending the string to our header above. The final string can then be written to an `.ATF` file using basic Python.

```
def make_row(t, row):
    """
    Convert single `row` of data into string format for .ATF file. 
    `t` = time (index of row divided by sampling frequency) 
        
    Returns string `s` representing respective row in ATF file 
    """
    s = "\n%0.5f" % t 
    for v in row[1:]:
        s += "\t%0.5f" % v
    
    return s 

def create_atf(filename=r"./output.atf"):
    """
    Save a stimulus waveform array as an ATF 1.0 file with filename `filename`
    """
    # create ATF header 
    header = make_header()
    
    # instantiate output string, beginning with ATF header 
    # data for each trace and tiempoint will be added as newlines (rows) 
    out = header
    
    # sampling frequency
    rate = 1000/(df_data[1,0] - df_data[0,0])
    print(" The sampling frequency is %.0f kHz" % rate)
    
    for i, val in enumerate(df_data):
        out += make_row(i/rate, val)
        
    with open(filename,'w') as f:
        f.write(out)
        print("wrote", filename)
```

While you don't need to necessarily save the Numpy array to a CSV file to create an ATF out of it, I find that it helps to do so for downstream analysis, which I'll get into below. First, let's see what the ATF file looks like when we open it in ClampFit (Axon Instruments).

### Bug warning!
So, although I've managed to make several protocols in the past using the code above, I recently tried it with the example in this post, and found that I needed to add an additional column to the data `df_data` before parsing it into a single string. Otherwise, even though the ATF header contains the right information (number of sweeps), the resulting file will only contain `N-1` sweeps, where the last sweep isn't saved. Here's the fix I used to do this:
```
df_data = pd.read_csv(protocol_path, header=0)
df_data.insert(df_data.shape[1], df_data.shape[1], 0.)
df_data = df_data.values 
```
Where, I simply added a column of zeros to the end of `df_data`. The rest of the procedure worked fine.

### Some more examples.
Here are a couple more examples of protocols I've created using this method. Again, these all open in ClampFit or Clampex just fine, and can be used in recording just like any other protocol.
