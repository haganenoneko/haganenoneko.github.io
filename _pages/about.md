*Welcome to my homepage.* 

I am currently a 2nd-year medical student at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. My inicipient interests in medicine currently include endocrinology, oncology, and hematology. At the moment, I am using this site to record random thoughts and notes from my readings and studies. These can be accessed at [../posts/](Posts).

In the past, I completed a Master's thesis on the kinetics of cardiac pacemaker channels [\[1](#ref-1)-[3\]](#ref-3), and I briefly supported a project on post-operative decline in children with severe neurological deficits [[4]](#ref-4). 

When not studying or thinking about medicine and science, I enjoy learning Japanese, anime/manga, programming, piano, and exercise.

<!-- I am currently a M.Sc. student in the Accili lab at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). Our lab is part of the [Cardiovascular Research Group](https://crg.lsi.ubc.ca/) in the [Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences](https://cps.med.ubc.ca/). 

My research interest is in the physiology of excitable cells that contribute to biological rhythms such as the cardiac pacemaking system. My work uses experimental and computational methods to understand the molecular mechanisms of how pacemaker 'HCN' channels open and close.
