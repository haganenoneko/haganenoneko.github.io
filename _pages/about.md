Welcome to my homepage. 

I am currently a M.Sc. student in the Accili lab at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). Our lab is part of the [Cardiovascular Research Group](https://crg.lsi.ubc.ca/) in the [Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences](https://cps.med.ubc.ca/). 

My research interest is in the physiology of excitable cells that contribute to biological rhythms such as the cardiac pacemaking system. My work uses experimental and computational methods to understand the molecular mechanisms of how pacemaker 'HCN' channels open and close. 

For my recent activities, see my [publications]({{ base_path }}/publications) and [talks]({{ base_path }}/talks).
